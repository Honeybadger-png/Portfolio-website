# Portfolio-website

As a note: 
  I created this website from a tutorial video in youtube channel named javascript mastery i have special thanks to channel for letting me to start this project. My goal is to show how i improved over time while adding new feature to this project also it will help me to learn the process of code,push,test,deploy and learn to create a decent website.

I wanted to learn javascript stack. For now without backend it is enough. Also i wanted to use 3d assets in my website. Because making 3d models gives peace to my mind when i get bored or depressed. I wanted to use react. It is my first javascript library and i felt comfortable. I didnt like using too much libraries to use 3d assets and Three.js doesnt let me use more than 15 3d canvases. I can guess it is because even witj low quality assets it takes time to load the assets. I might need to find solutions for this problem in the future if i am going to use lots of 3d assets.

Current State:
- Making my own asset to changed used asset for my table. I try to closest view of my table.
  - Created my laptop monitor and textured them to look good. I have some worry about my asset could have too large for the app and letting asset to load in like 1 min. If this happen i need to work on the topology to - 
    reduce polygons.
