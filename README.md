Instructions to be able to run the app in your local and inspect the website:
For frontend After npm install .env file should be created in the src and REACT_APP_LOCAL_URL should be defined and pass localhost url with port:5555
this should be enough to open frontpage.

For backend there will be more thinks to add than frontpage
First npm install and after that .env file should be created.
In .env file PORT variable should be pass and this need to be same with frontend Port variable
Then mongoDBURL should be defined and add your MongoDB connection string and rename the need fields.
Then Secret key should be added as well.
Probably this will be enough for the backend.

ABOUT THE PROJECT AND SOME NOTES FROM MYSELF
As someone whose desire to become a Full Stack Developer. One of the first project is probably a portfolio site. And of course this wasnt my first portfolio site. My first website was so basic with static data and I just used HTML and CSS.
I can say it wasnt a website with perfect design techniques.
So for that reason there was some intention to make a good looking website and be able to change content from a dashboard so I will be able to add my new Projects in the future.
I have almost come to an end for completing the website and I wanna make it live ASAP. I might do some improvements. I have so much things to learn and experience it in a project.

There are variaty of technologies that I have used in this project. Besides React, NodeJS, Express and Mongo . I have used ThreeJS to show some cool 3D assets. I know they are free assets and I created them from tutorial but I like working with 3D models so I am modelling
new Assets to use them in my front page. Also framer-motion helped to create some cool animations. there are some more features that I want to add . So I will continue working on this project. Thank you for your patience to read. Have a nice day and be safe!
