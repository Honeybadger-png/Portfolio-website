# Portfolio-website

As a note: 
  I created this website from a tutorial video in youtube channel named javascript mastery i have special thanks to channel for letting me to start this project. My goal is to show how i improved over time while adding new feature to this project also it will help me to learn the process of code,push,test,deploy and learn to create a decent website.

in this project i work on my portfolio website using front-end tools, react, three.js to use 3d and make a 3d portfolio app. 

Current State:
- Making my own asset to changed used asset for my table. I try to closest view of my table.
  - Created my laptop monitor and textured them to look good. I have some worry about my asset could have too large for the app and letting asset to load in like 1 min. If this happen i need to work on the topology to - 
    reduce polygons.
