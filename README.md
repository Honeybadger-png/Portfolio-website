# Portfolio-website

in this project i work on my portfolio website using front-end tools, react, three.js to use 3d and make a 3d portfolio app. 

Because of i do 3d models as a hobby i wanted to make my own assets.
I will make the app live as soon as possible.And i want to add some features and continue developing.
All the files can be seen in the master branch.
